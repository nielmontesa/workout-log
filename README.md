# Workout Log App

A workout tracking app built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. Still in progress!

## What it does

- Log workouts with exercises, sets, reps, and weight.
- Track workout history
- Calculate personal records

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Supabase (database & auth)
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand for state management

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You'll need to set up your own Supabase project and add the credentials to a `.env` file:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=your_key
```

## Status

Working through this 2-week project to learn more about TypeScript and Supabase!
